						<h1>CARD PLUS Risk Disclosure Statement</h1>
						<h2>PLEASE READ THIS RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT CAREFULLY. BY EXECUTING THE ACCOUNT MANDATE, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CONFIRMATION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND UNDERSTAND THE RISKS.</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="list-container">
						<h3>Market risk</h3>
						<div>The investment can be a volatile instrument and may be subject to considerable fluctuations
							in value and other risks inherent in investing in the investment derivatives. The value of
							the investment may fall as rapidly as it may rise</div>
						<h3>Risk of underlying assets</h3>
						<div>
							The investments could offer investors a return based on the returns of the underlying assets
							into which the investment proceeds shall be invested, while subject to the credit risk of
							the relevant counterparty and/or the reference entity, and of any other issuer or
							counterparty of the underlying assets and/or any reference entity or reference obligations
							relevant to any investment of investment proceeds. Returns on the investments are dependent
							on the returns to be received.
						</div>
						<h3>Loss of principal risk</h3>
						<div>
							The Investments are NOT principal protected. In the worst case scenario, an investor may
							lose its entire investment in the investments. An investor should not purchase the
							investments unless it accepts the risk of losing all or a substantial part of its
							investment.
						</div>
						<h3>Not a deposit</h3>
						<div>
							The investments are not time deposits and are therefore not protected by the Deposit
							Protection Scheme in Hong Kong
						</div>
						<h3>Under performance risk</h3>
						<div>
							Potential return on the investments may be less than returns on a bank deposit, a
							nonstructured fixed coupon Investment or any other investments.
						</div>
						<h3>Credit risk</h3>
						<div>
							The investments constitute direct and unsubordinated contractual obligations. The
							investments are collateralised and secured on the underlying assets into which the
							Investment proceeds shall be invested. The Trustee has minimal assets and share capital.
						</div>
						<h3>Possible conflicts of interest risk</h3>
						<div>
							There could be conflicts of interest arising out of the activities of the Trustee and/or its
							affiliates. The Trustee and/or its affiliates may act in a number of capacities in respect
							of the investments or the underlying asset(s) of the investments. Potential conflicts of
							interest may arise in relation to the Trustee and its affiliates and their respective roles
							as they may retain various powers of discretion which may have a material impact on the
							value and performance of the investments. These discretions may be exercised (or not be
							exercised) in a way that could adversely affect the investors. The Trustee and/or its
							affiliates may, at the date hereof or at any time hereafter, be in possession of information
							in relation to the underlying assets of the investments that are or may be material in the
							context of the investments and may or may not be publicly available to investors. There is
							no obligation on the Trustee and/or its affiliates to disclose to investors any such
							information, even where such information may be material to the decision by an investor as
							to whether or not to purchase the Investments. The Trustee and its affiliates owe no duty to
							the investment holders to avoid the above conflicts or disclose them. If any of the above
							activities adversely affect the Investments, the Trustee and its affiliates are not
							responsible for any losses.
						</div>
						<h3>Foreign exchange risk</h3>
						<div>
							Investors in the investment will bear a foreign exchange risk should the exchange rates
							change during the life of the investment. Any depreciation of currencies between
							subscription for the investments and repatriation of proceeds for the investments would mean
							that the return on the investments would be adversely affected. Investors should note that
							such fluctuation in the exchange rate may affect any positive price performance of the
							Investments such that the redemption amount payable maybe substantially increased or
							reduced.
						</div>
						<h3>General investment risk</h3>
						<div>
							There is no guarantee that in any time period, particularly in the short term, the Portfolio
							into which the Investment proceeds shall be invested will achieve appreciation in terms of
							capital growth. The Portfolio may be subject to market fluctuations and to all the risks
							inherent in all investments and markets. As a result, the net asset value of the Portfolio
							and therefore the redemption amount payable to the Investment Holder may go down as well as
							up. Investment in the Portfolio involves risks. It is possible that an investor may lose a
							substantial proportion or all of its investment in the Portfolio.
						</div>
						<h3>Concentration risk</h3>
						<div>
							The investment of the Portfolio may be concentrated in a particular investment, market or
							country. A concentrated investment strategy may be subject to a greater degree of volatility
							and risk than a diversified investment strategy. To the extent the Portfolio concentrates
							its investment in a particular investment, market or country, its investments will become
							more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse economic or business
							conditions with respect thereto. As a consequence, the return on investments of the
							investment proceeds into the Portfolio that adopts a concentrated investment strategy may be
							adversely affected by the unfavourable developments in the particular investment, markets or
							countries in which the Portfolio invests.
						</div>
						<h3>Liquidity risk</h3>
						<div>
							The market for some securities in which the Portfolio may invest may be relatively illiquid
							and the liquidity of certain of the markets generally has fluctuated substantially over
							time. Liquidity relates to the ability of the Portfolio to sell an investment in a timely
							manner. The market for relatively illiquid securities tends to be more volatile than the
							market for more liquid securities. Investment of the Portfolio’s assets in relatively
							illiquid securities may restrict the ability of the Portfolio to dispose of its investments
							at a price and time that it wishes to do so.
						</div>
						<h3>Risks relating to the lack of management control by Investment Holder</h3>
						<div>
							The investment holders have no right or power to take part in the management or control of
							the Portfolio. The Portfolio is managed solely by the Investment Manager. Investment holders
							must rely solely on the judgment of the Investment Manager in managing the investments and
							should not invest in the Investment unless willing to entrust all aspects of the management
							of the Portfolio and its investments to the Investment Manager.
						</div>
						<h3>Taxation risk</h3>
						<div>
							Each investor is advised to consult the investor’s own tax advisers. Tax rules and their
							interpretation in relation to interests in the Portfolio may change during the life of the
							Portfolio which may have an adverse effect on the Portfolio, the investors and the
							Portfolio’s investments and investment opportunities. There can be no assurance that any tax
							authority or court will agree with any particular interpretation of the relevant laws. Any
							relevant tax authority may conduct tax reviews on the transactions conducted by the
							Portfolio and impose additional taxes in respect of previous periods. If the Portfolio makes
							investments in a jurisdiction, the Portfolio or the investors may be subject to income or
							other tax in that jurisdiction. In addition, withholding taxes may be imposed on income of
							the Portfolio from investments in certain jurisdictions.
